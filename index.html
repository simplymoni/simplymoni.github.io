    <p style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow:</p>
    <p>
        Most of our students cannot write out their
        examination papers fairly. As they cannot understand
        the questions properly, they often beat about the bush
        and cram their answers with irrelevant and unnecessary
        details. Sometimes they also fail to arrange their answer
        neatly, cleanly and systemically. Although the teacher
        suggests that their answer should be brief and precise,
        they often lengthen them unnecessarily. Where size does not
        matter at all, they have a silly notion that the more they
        write, the more marks they will get. The reality is just
        the opposite; their long answers generally become disgusting
        and unsavory. Such answers always earn unhappy marks.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to get expected marks, all you should do, is to
        understand the questions well and answer them just to
        the point. Don't worry, if your answers are fairly short.
        You should not play any time they may sound discordant.
        Be sure your sentences make sense. Above all, you need a
        neat presentation. To answer the short comprehensive
        questions, you should not copy anything blindly from
        the passage. Try to answer the questions more or less
        in your own English. Frame your answers exactly in the
        same tense and aspect on the questions are in. Don't
        forget to write short and simple sentences. Plain and
        clean English is not bad.

    <p style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">(a) What is the purpose of the passage?</p>
    <p style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">(b) Write down the meaning of the following words in English
       and make your own sentences with them:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Irrelevant</li>
      <li>Cram </li>
      <li>Precise</li>
      <li>Disgusting</li>
      <li>Lengthen</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">(c) What do you understand from the following long sentences?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
          As they cannot understand the questions properly, they
          often beat about the bush and cram their answers with
          irrelevant and unnecessary details.

    <h3 style="color:green">Point of view</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people
      to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work,
      but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity
      of the sea.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color:green">Life is beautiful</h3>
    <p>
      Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that?
      We must have perseverance and above all confidence
      in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for
      something, and that this thing, at whatever cost,
      must be attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do what you love to do and give it your very best.
      Whether it's business or baseball, or the theater,
      or any field. If you don't love what you're doing and
      you can't give it your best, get out of it.
      Life is too short.
      You'll be an old man before you know it.
